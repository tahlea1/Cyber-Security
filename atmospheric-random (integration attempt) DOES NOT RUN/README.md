# atmospheric-random
===================================================
Hello! This piece of code currently does not run! However this is my attempt at integrating the redback 2FA project with the atmospheric random project. If you have stronger java skills than me and are feeling brave, I recommend attempting to fix my attempt! Resources I used can be found at the mvpjava links below as well as in Redback Documentations. Happy coding!  - Tahlea 

===================================================
Demo Java Tutorial on how to create a true random number via random.org which use atmospheric noise as its source!

This demo supports the Blog Post "Generating a Random Number in Java From Atmospheric Noise" at mvpjava.com at this link http://mvpjava.com/java-atmospheric-random/

You will have to get your own API key from random.org (free) and include it in the application.properties file as the 'apiKey'
If you do not, you will be using an expired key and you'll get the following error message "!!!! An error occurred null ... returning an empty value !!!!"
